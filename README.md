## About CAFE

CAFE (Crypto-Agility Framework for Ethereum) is a three-service platform designed to discover, govern, and remediate cryptographic assets on Ethereum—ensuring compliance, resilience, and trust in the post-quantum and zero-knowledge era.

### Architecture

CAFE is composed of three main services:

1. **Discovery** — Identification of on-chain and network quantum exposures
2. **Crypto Policy Manager** — Definition and enforcement of cryptographic policies
3. **Remediation** — Secure migration and attested key operations
