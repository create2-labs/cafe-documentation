## Dashboard

The Dashboard provides an overview of your security scanning activity and statistics.

### Overview Statistics

The dashboard displays four key metrics:

- **Total Scans** — Total number of scans performed (wallet + TLS)
- **High Risk** — Number of scans with high quantum risk
- **Medium Risk** — Number of scans with medium quantum risk
- **Safe** — Number of scans with low or no quantum risk

### Recent Scans

The dashboard shows your most recent scans, including:

- **Wallet scans** — Ethereum addresses scanned
- **TLS scans** — Endpoints scanned
- **Risk level** — Visual indicator (🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Safe)
- **Scan date** — When the scan was performed

### Quick Actions

From the dashboard, you can:

- **Start a new scan** — Click the "New Scan" button to scan a wallet or TLS endpoint
- **View scan details** — Click on any scan result to see detailed information
- **Filter scans** — Use the filters to find specific scans

## Wallet Scanning

CAFE can scan Ethereum wallets to assess their quantum vulnerability by checking if the public key has been exposed on-chain.

### Starting a Wallet Scan

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** or **Wallet Scans**
2. Click the **"New Scan"** button
3. In the scan modal:
   - Select **"Wallet Address"** as the scan type
   - Enter an Ethereum address (must start with `0x`)
   - Click **"Scan"**

### Understanding Wallet Scan Results

After scanning, you'll see one of three risk states:

#### 🔴 High Risk — Public Key Exposed

- **Meaning**: The wallet has executed at least one transaction
- **Risk**: The public key is permanently visible on the blockchain, making it vulnerable to future quantum attacks
- **Action**: Consider migrating to a quantum-safe Account Abstraction wallet (ERC-4337)

#### 🟡 Medium Risk — Public Key Not Exposed

- **Meaning**: The wallet has never executed a transaction
- **Risk**: While not immediately threatened, any future transaction would expose the public key
- **Action**: Consider creating a new quantum-safe wallet before first use

#### 🟢 Low Risk — CAFE Wallet Attached

- **Meaning**: The wallet is a CAFE-managed Account Abstraction wallet with PQC support
- **Risk**: Minimal — protected by post-quantum cryptography
- **Action**: Continue using this wallet for quantum-safe operations

### Multi-Chain Support

CAFE automatically scans wallets across multiple Ethereum-compatible chains:

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Arbitrum One
- Optimism
- Base
- Polygon
- And more...

The scan results show the risk status for each chain where the address has activity.

### Scan Details

Clicking on a scan result shows detailed information:

- **Address** — The Ethereum wallet address
- **Account Type** — EOA (Externally Owned Account) or AA (Account Abstraction)
- **Algorithm** — Cryptographic algorithm used (e.g., ECDSA-secp256k1)
- **NIST Security Level** — Quantum security level (1-5)
- **Key Exposed** — Whether the public key is visible on-chain
- **Risk Score** — Numerical risk assessment (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Networks** — Chains where the address has activity
- **CBOM** — Cryptographic Bill of Materials in CycloneDX format

## TLS Endpoint Scanning

CAFE can scan TLS endpoints (HTTPS URLs) to assess their post-quantum cryptography readiness.

### Starting a TLS Scan

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** or **TLS Scans**
2. Click the **"New Scan"** button
3. In the scan modal:
   - Select **"TLS Endpoint"** as the scan type
   - Enter an HTTPS URL (must start with `https://`)
   - Optionally specify a custom port (e.g., `https://example.com:8443`)
   - Click **"Scan"**

### Understanding TLS Scan Results

TLS scan results include:

#### Certificate Analysis

- **Subject** — Certificate subject (e.g., CN=example.com)
- **Issuer** — Certificate Authority
- **Signature Algorithm** — Algorithm used to sign the certificate
- **NIST Security Level** — Quantum security level of the certificate
- **PQC Ready** — Whether the certificate uses post-quantum cryptography

#### TLS Protocol Analysis
