## Getting Started

### Accessing CAFE

CAFE is accessible via a web browser.

### First Visit

When you first visit CAFE, you can:

- **Browse anonymously** — View default endpoints and scan results without creating an account; to run new scans you must sign in or sign up. Anonymous data are temporary and not persisted long-term.
- **Create an account** — Sign up to run scans and save your results; your scans are stored in the backend so you can retrieve them when you reconnect.
- **Sign in** — If you already have an account

### Navigation

The main navigation menu provides access to:

- **Home** — Landing page with links to Discovery, Crypto Policy Management, and Remediation
- **Discovery** — Tabbed section with:
  - **Introduction** — Overview of Discovery (wallet and TLS exposure)
  - **Dashboard** — Overview of your scans and security statistics
  - **Wallet scan** — View and manage wallet security scans
  - **TLS scan** — View and manage TLS endpoint security scans
- **Crypto Policy Management** — Govern crypto policies for wallet assets (CPM)
- **Remediation** — Migration to post-quantum–resistant cryptography
- **Platform** — Sub-pages: **Status** (health, versions), **Security** (token inspection, refresh)
- **Networks (Chains)** — View supported blockchain networks
- **Settings** — Manage your profile and view plan information
- **Wallets** — Manage your saved wallets (requires authentication)

## Authentication

### Sign Up

To create a new account:

1. Click **Sign Up** in the navigation menu or on the sign-in page
2. Fill in the registration form:
   - **Email address** — Your email (used for login)
   - **Password** — Choose a strong password
   - **Confirm Password** — Re-enter your password
3. Complete the **Cloudflare Turnstile** verification (bot protection)
4. Click **Sign Up**

### Sign In

To sign in to your account:

1. Click **Sign In** in the navigation menu
2. Enter your **email address** and **password**
3. Complete the **Cloudflare Turnstile** verification
4. Click **Sign In**

After successful authentication, you'll receive a hybrid PQC JWT token (EdDSA + ML-DSA-65) that is automatically stored and used for subsequent API requests.

### Sign Out

To sign out:

1. Click on your profile/email in the navigation
2. Select **Sign Out**

Your session will be cleared and you'll be redirected to the sign-in page.

## Dashboard

The Discovery **Dashboard** (`/discovery/dashboard`) provides an overview of your security scanning activity and statistics.

### Overview Statistics

The dashboard displays four key metrics:

- **Total Scans** — Total number of scans performed (wallet + TLS)
- **High Risk** — Number of scans with high quantum risk
- **Medium Risk** — Number of scans with medium quantum risk
- **Safe** — Number of scans with low or no quantum risk

### Recent Scans

The dashboard shows your most recent scans, including:

- **Wallet scans** — Ethereum addresses scanned
- **TLS scans** — Endpoints scanned
- **Risk level** — Visual indicator (🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Safe)
- **Scan date** — When the scan was performed

### Quick Actions

From the dashboard, you can:

- **Start a new scan** — Click the "New Scan" button to scan a wallet or TLS endpoint
- **View scan details** — Click on any scan result to see detailed information
- **Filter scans** — Use the filters to find specific scans

## Wallet Scanning

CAFE can scan Ethereum wallets to assess their quantum vulnerability by checking if the public key has been exposed on-chain.

### Starting a Wallet Scan

1. Navigate to **Discovery → Dashboard** or **Discovery → Wallet scan**
2. Click the **"New Scan"** button (sign-in required if you are in anonymous mode)
3. In the scan modal:
   - Select **"Wallet Address"** as the scan type
   - Enter an Ethereum address (must start with `0x`)
   - Click **"Scan"**

### Understanding Wallet Scan Results

After scanning, you'll see one of three risk states:

#### 🔴 High Risk — Public Key Exposed

- **Meaning**: The wallet has executed at least one transaction
- **Risk**: The public key is permanently visible on the blockchain, making it vulnerable to future quantum attacks
- **Action**: Consider migrating to a quantum-safe Account Abstraction wallet (ERC-4337)

#### 🟡 Medium Risk — Public Key Not Exposed

- **Meaning**: The wallet has never executed a transaction
- **Risk**: While not immediately threatened, any future transaction would expose the public key
- **Action**: Consider creating a new quantum-safe wallet before first use

#### 🟢 Low Risk — CAFE Wallet Attached

- **Meaning**: The wallet is a CAFE-managed Account Abstraction wallet with PQC support
- **Risk**: Minimal — protected by post-quantum cryptography
- **Action**: Continue using this wallet for quantum-safe operations

### Multi-Chain Support

CAFE automatically scans wallets across multiple Ethereum-compatible chains:

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Arbitrum One
- Optimism
- Base
- Polygon
- And more...

The scan results show the risk status for each chain where the address has activity.

### Scan Details

Clicking on a scan result shows detailed information:

- **Address** — The Ethereum wallet address
- **Account Type** — EOA (Externally Owned Account) or AA (Account Abstraction)
- **Algorithm** — Cryptographic algorithm used (e.g., ECDSA-secp256k1)
- **NIST Security Level** — Quantum security level (1-5)
- **Key Exposed** — Whether the public key is visible on-chain
- **Risk Score** — Numerical risk assessment (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Networks** — Chains where the address has activity
- **CBOM** — Cryptographic Bill of Materials in CycloneDX format

## TLS Endpoint Scanning

CAFE can scan TLS endpoints (HTTPS URLs) to assess their post-quantum cryptography readiness.

### Starting a TLS Scan

1. Navigate to **Discovery → Dashboard** or **Discovery → TLS scan**
2. Click the **"New Scan"** button (sign-in required if you are in anonymous mode)
3. In the scan modal:
   - Select **"TLS Endpoint"** as the scan type
   - Enter an HTTPS URL (must start with `https://`)
   - Optionally specify a custom port (e.g., `https://example.com:8443`)
   - Click **"Scan"**

### Understanding TLS Scan Results

TLS scan results include:

#### Certificate Analysis

- **Subject** — Certificate subject (e.g., CN=example.com)
- **Issuer** — Certificate Authority
- **Signature Algorithm** — Algorithm used to sign the certificate

2. Create an account or sign in
3. Your previous anonymous scans will not be transferred (they expire)
4. Run new scans with your account to build your scan history

## Tips and Best Practices

### Wallet Security

1. **Scan before first use** — Check if a wallet address has been used before
2. **Avoid reusing exposed addresses** — If a public key is exposed, create a new wallet
3. **Use Account Abstraction** — Consider migrating to ERC-4337 wallets for quantum safety
4. **Multi-chain awareness** — Check risk status across all chains you use

### TLS Security

1. **Scan critical endpoints** — Regularly scan RPC nodes and API endpoints you use
2. **Monitor PQC readiness** — Check if endpoints support post-quantum cryptography
3. **Review recommendations** — Follow security recommendations from scan results
4. **Check default endpoints** — Review pre-scanned default endpoints for known issues

### Account Management

1. **Save important wallets** — Use the wallet management feature for frequently scanned addresses
2. **Monitor usage** — Check your plan usage in Settings
3. **Review scan history** — Regularly review your scan results to track security posture
4. **Upgrade plan if needed** — Consider upgrading if you hit plan limits

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Not Starting

- **Check address format** — Wallet addresses must start with `0x` and be 42 characters
- **Check URL format** — TLS endpoints must start with `https://`
- **Check plan limits** — Verify you haven't exceeded your scan limit
- **Try refreshing** — Refresh the page and try again

### Results Not Appearing

- **Wait for processing** — Scans are processed asynchronously; wait a few seconds
- **Check anonymous mode** — Anonymous scans expire after 30 minutes
- **Refresh the page** — Results may need a page refresh to appear
- **Check filters** — Ensure filters aren't hiding your results

### Authentication Issues

- **Check credentials** — Verify email and password are correct
- **Check Turnstile** — Complete the Cloudflare Turnstile verification
- **Clear browser cache** — Clear cookies and localStorage if issues persist
- **Try token refresh** — Use the Security page to refresh your token

### Network Errors

- **Check connection** — Verify your internet connection
- **Check API status** — Verify backend services are running
- **Try again later** — Temporary network issues may resolve themselves
